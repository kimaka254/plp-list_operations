# List Operations Script

This Python script is part of **Week 2's Assignment** for the **Power Learn Project (PLP)**. It demonstrates basic Python list operations such as appending, inserting, extending, removing, sorting, and finding an index.

## File Name
`list_operations.py`

## Features

The script performs the following operations on a list:

1. Creates an empty list called `my_list`
2. Appends the values `10`, `20`, `30`, and `40` to the list
3. Inserts the value `15` at the second position (index 1)
4. Extends the list with `[50, 60, 70]`
5. Removes the last element from the list
6. Sorts the list in ascending order
7. Finds and prints the index of the value `30`

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
No external libraries or packages are needed.

## How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run the script with:

```bash
python list_operations.py
